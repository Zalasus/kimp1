kimp1
=====

Software for my Z80 microcomputer kimp1. Includes generic libraries,
an overengineered monitor program and CP/M stuff.

All the assembly files are written for the zmac assembler, to be found
here: http://members.shaw.ca/gp2000/zmac.html

Most of this code was written by Zalasus (me). Feel free to use it as
you please. Just don't go all Oracle on me.
